        <h2 class="section-title">About SafeSpace</h2>

        <p class="section-text">
            SafeSpace was created with a simple idea: everyone deserves a safe environment to express their emotions.
            Many people struggle silently, afraid to share what they feel due to judgment, stigma, or lack of support.
            Our mission is to make emotional help accessible, confidential, and human — whenever you need it.
        </p>

        <!-- Mission -->
        <h3 class="sub-title">Our Mission</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
            Our mission is to provide a secure and private digital space where individuals can connect with trained
            listeners, access emotional tools, and find comfort in moments when they feel alone. We aim to reduce
            emotional barriers and make support available to anyone, anywhere.
        </p>

        <!-- Vision -->
        <h3 class="sub-title">Our Vision</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
            We envision a world where emotional support is not a luxury, but a fundamental part of everyday life.
            SafeSpace seeks to become a global platform that empowers people to open up, heal, and grow without fear,
            while promoting empathy and healthy communication.
